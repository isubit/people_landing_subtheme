# people_landing_subtheme
A Suitcase_Interim subtheme to style a People profile like a landing page

This is a subtheme of Suitcase_Interim, and the only thing it does is override the node template for the People content type. We typically use this for simple Luggage sites that are acting as a profile for a single individual, and the homepage is the single People node.

Please note: Currently, *all* People nodes will receive the new template. 

## Installation
Install a subtheme in the same way you would a regular theme. Drupal 7 documentation on installing themes: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/extend/installing-themes

When the subtheme has been installed, enable and set as default.
